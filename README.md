[//]: # 'TEMPLATE NOTE START'

# HOW TO GET STARTED

- Run `yarn install`
- You can change all mentions of the project within files and folders in your repo by running `bash rename.sh` and following instructions.
- Please make sure to run `watchman watch-del-all` and `npm start --reset-cache` before re-running the app.

# HOW TO CHANGE ICONS

- Download your icon as SVG format on your computer and go to your figma project, duplicated from the Design System Template (`https://www.figma.com/file/vEO1Adp6j0nHiiq9BiexE1/Design-System-Template?node-id=484%3A513`).
- Go to the page "Logos/Backgrounds" and drop your logo in there. Resize it if needed then click on it and copy it (Cmd + C). On the layers panel, click "App Icon (edit this)", then "Icon (edit this)", right click "Foreground" and select "Paste to replace". Delete the original icon that you just copied.
- If the background is a simple color, adjust it by clicking on it and changing the "Fill" color on the right panel. If more complex, reproduce the previous step.
- Once you have finished to edit your icon and background, click on "Icon exporting", "Exports", "Icon (export this)", and follow the instructions in "ðŸ“² Icon exporting" (export is on the right panel).
- Replace the content of Foreground.svg and Background.svg in your repository with the values you just exported.
- At the root of the repo, run `yarn icons:generate`.
- Rebuild the app.

# HOW TO CHANGE BOOTSPLASH

- Do the same procedure than for icons, following the steps above until the export.
- Follow the instructions in in "ðŸ“² Bootsplash exporting" (export is on the right panel).
- Replace the logo.png in "assets/bootsplash" in your repo by your downloaded png file (rename it if necessary).
- At the root of the repo, run `yarn bootsplash:generate`.
- Rebuild the app.

# react-native-template

Template for mobile applications implemented with React Native and released with Visual Studio App Center. You can create a new project from this template by running `taito project create: react-native-template`. You can also migrate an existing react-native project by running `taito project migrate: react-native-template` in your project root folder.

## Architecture Overview

DIAGRAM: You can use [Gravizo](https://www.gravizo.com) for making a architecture diagram if the diagram does not contain any confidential information. Note that architecture diagram is not mandatory if the architecture is very simple.

### Integrations

- Client uses Google Maps
- Server uses system X for authorization (OAUTH)
- Server fetches products from system Y (REST/json)
- Server sends email using Sendgrid (REST/json)

### Processes

Only non-trivial processes need to be described here (e.g. scheduled batch processing), though it might be a good idea to describe one or two basic scenarios also. Architecture is the main focus here. User stories should be documented elsewhere (e.g. wiki).

#### Basic Scenario

1. User performs action on UI
2. Server authorizes action by system X
3. Server reads/updates database
4. Server returns value

#### Product Snapshots

1. User performs action on UI
2. Server adds message to queue
3. ...
4. ...
5. Server sends email

#### Scheduled Jobs
