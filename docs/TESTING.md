# Testing

We are using [Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev/) for testing. Maestro is a tool for running tests on real devices.

## Prerequisites

You need to install Maestro CLI following the instructions [here](https://maestro.mobile.dev/getting-started/installing-maestro).



## Open the Maestro studio

Run `maestro studio` in the terminal. This will open the Maestro studio in your browser. You can use the studio to write your tests in a more interactive and visual way.

## Writing tests

You can write your tests in the Maestro studio or in a YAML file. See the [Maestro documentation](https://maestro.mobile.dev/api-reference/commands) for more info on the commands you can use.

## Run tests

You can run tests in the terminal with the following command:

```
maestro test ./tests/YOUR_TEST_FILE.yml
```
