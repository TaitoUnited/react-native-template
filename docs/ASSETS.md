# Assets

## Fonts

The fonts are generated from the Figma project.

They are stored in the `src/design-system/fonts` folder. They are loaded from the `src/utils/font.ts` file in the `useAppReady` function used in `init.ts`.

To update the fonts you need to go to the `Fonts` page in your Figma project (for example, [here](https://www.figma.com/file/vEO1Adp6j0nHiiq9BiexE1/Design-System-Template?type=design&node-id=484-513&mode=design&t=nA3zndYafwTldGs8-0)). Edit the fonts there, respecting the guidelines explained in the page. Once you are done, you can simply run the script `design-system:sync` to update the fonts in the app.

## App icon & Splash screen

The app icon and splash screen are generated from the Figma project.

To update the app icon and splash screen you need to go to the `App Icon & Splash` page in your Figma project (for example, [here](https://www.figma.com/file/vEO1Adp6j0nHiiq9BiexE1/Design-System-Template?type=design&node-id=484-513&mode=design&t=nA3zndYafwTldGs8-0)). Edit the assets there, respecting the guidelines explained in the page. Once you are done, you can simply run the script `design-system:sync` to update the assets in the app.

## Adding new assets

To add new assets to the app, you need to add them to the `src/assets` folder. You can then import them in your components or screens.

It is recommended to separate them in folders based on their type (e.g. `images`, `animations`, `sounds`, etc.).

### FAQ
