### Splash screen is not updating

On iOS Simulator the splash screen is cached which can cause issues when you are making modifications to the splash screen assets. In order to have the splash screen updated you need to:

1. Uninstall the app in the simulator
2. Restart the simulator (`Device` â†’ `Restart`)
