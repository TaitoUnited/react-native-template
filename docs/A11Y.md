## Why Accessibility Matters

Accessibility ensures that users with various disabilities can navigate and interact with your app effectively. By incorporating accessibility features, you not only make your app more inclusive but also create a more intuitive and user-friendly experience for everyone. Key benefits include:

- **Expanding Your User Base**: Accessibility opens up your app to a wider audience, including individuals with disabilities, allowing more users to benefit from your product.
- **Enhancing User Experience**: Thoughtfully designed accessibility features improve the overall usability of your app, making navigation more seamless for everyone, not just those who rely on assistive technologies.
- **Meeting Legal and Regulatory Standards**: Compliance with international regulations such as the European Accessibility Act (EAA), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) helps you avoid legal issues and meet important standards for inclusivity.

By prioritizing accessibility, you can ensure your app is usable and enjoyable for all users, whether or not they rely on assistive technologies like screen readers or magnifiers.

Considerations for Different Disabilities

When designing for accessibility, it’s essential to address the needs of users with a wide range of disabilities. Here are key considerations for different types of impairments:

- **Visual Impairments**: For users with low vision or blindness, make sure that text is readable by using large, scalable fonts and high-contrast color schemes. Ensure all images, icons, and visual elements have descriptive alternative text that screen readers can convey effectively. Use meaningful content structures, like headings, to help users navigate easily.

- **Auditory Impairments**: Users with hearing impairments may not be able to hear audio content. Include captions and transcripts for all audio and video media. Ensure that important auditory notifications, such as alarms or alerts, are also conveyed visually or through haptic feedback.

- **Cognitive Impairments**: For users with cognitive disabilities, such as dyslexia or ADHD, keep language simple and concise. Avoid overly complex navigation or instructions, and ensure consistent layouts to help users understand the structure of the app. Providing extra time for interactions, such as dismissing pop-ups or responding to alerts, can also improve usability.

- **Motor Impairments**: Users with limited dexterity or motor impairments benefit from designs that offer large touch targets, minimal gestures, and the ability to navigate via keyboard or alternative input devices. Ensure that interactive elements, such as buttons and links, are spaced far enough apart to prevent accidental touches and provide ample time for users to respond.

By considering the unique challenges faced by users with different types of disabilities, you can design a more inclusive app that offers an excellent experience for everyone, regardless of their abilities.

## Accessibility in React Native

### Basic Accessibility Properties

React Native components support several accessibility properties to help screen readers describe elements correctly.

- **`accessible`**: Marks a view as accessible. When set to `true`, the screen reader will focus on this view and read its content.

> **Note**: Interactive elements like buttons or links have `accessible` set to `true` by default. Text components are also read by screen readers without the need for `accessible`.

```jsx
<View accessible>
  <Text>Accessible Text</Text>
</View>
```

> **Important**: If you set `accessible` to a wrapper view, no interactive elements inside it will be accessible.

- **`accessibilityLabel`**: Provides a string description that the screen reader will read instead of the view’s content. This is helpful when the visual content doesn’t accurately convey the action or state of the component.

```jsx
<Button accessibilityLabel="Submit the form" onPress={submitForm}>
  Submit
</Button>
```

- **`accessibilityHint`**: Describes the action that will occur when a user interacts with a component.

```jsx
<Button
  accessibilityLabel="Submit the form"
  accessibilityHint="Double tap to submit the form and proceed to checkout"
  onPress={submitForm}
>
  Submit
</Button>
```

- **`accessibilityValue`**: Provides information about the value of a component. This is useful for elements like sliders or progress bars.

```jsx
<Slider
  accessibilityLabel="Volume control"
  accessibilityHint="Swipe up or down to adjust the volume"
  accessibilityValue={{ min: 0, max: 100, now: volume }}
  onValueChange={setVolume}
/>
```

### Labeling and Hints

Proper labeling is crucial for screen reader users. Every interactive element, like buttons, switches, or links, should have clear labels. Here are some best practices:

- **Custom Labels**: Use `accessibilityLabel` when the visual content is not clear or when an image or icon needs a description.
- **Hints**: Add `accessibilityHint` to further describe the action that occurs when the element is interacted with.

Example:

```jsx
<IconButton
  icon="trash"
  accessibilityLabel="Delete item"
  accessibilityHint="Double tap to delete this item from the list"
  onPress={deleteItem}
/>
```

### Accessibility Roles

Roles define the purpose of an element, so screen readers can announce it properly. Here are common roles:

- **`button`**: Indicates a tappable button.
- **`header`**: Marks a heading section.
- **`image`**: Declares an image.
- **`link`**: Declares a hyperlink.

Example:

```jsx
<Text variant="headingL" accessibilityRole="header">
  <Trans>Enter your credentials</Trans>
</Text>
```

You can find a full list of roles in the [React Native Accessibility documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilityrole).

> **Note**: use `accessibilityRole` consistently to ensure that assistive technologies like screen readers can accurately interpret component behavior.

### Custom Accessibility Actions

For complex interactions, React Native provides `accessibilityActions` to define custom actions for a view. This allows you to provide additional context or control for assistive technology users.

Example:

```jsx
<View
  accessible
  accessibilityActions={[
    { name: 'activate', label: 'Activate' },
    { name: 'longpress', label: 'Long Press' },
  ]}
  onAccessibilityAction={(event) => {
    switch (event.nativeEvent.actionName) {
      case 'activate':
        // Handle activate action
        break;
      case 'longpress':
        // Handle long press action
        break;
    }
  }}
>
  <Text>Custom Accessible View</Text>
</View>
```

More information on custom actions can be found in the [React Native Accessibility documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibility-actions).

### Dynamic Font Sizes

Respecting users’ preferred text sizes is crucial for inclusivity. The `allowFontScaling` prop enables text scaling in the Text component, ensuring that the app adapts to the user’s preferences.

```jsx
<Text allowFontScaling={true}>This text scales with user preferences</Text>
```

> **Note**: The default value for `allowFontScaling` is `true`, so you can omit it if you want the text to scale.

However, it’s essential to consider how changes in font size may affect your app’s layout and design.

Developers should thoroughly test UI components when adjusting text sizes to ensure that the overall user interface remains visually coherent and functional. Consider how larger text may overlap with other elements or push them off-screen, and adjust layouts as needed to maintain a good user experience.

### Accessibility Info API

The `AccessibilityInfo` API provides methods to interact with accessibility services, allowing developers to get information about the accessibility settings on the device and to send accessibility announcements to assistive technologies.

However, to streamline accessibility management and enhance usability, we have created a custom utility component, `a11y.ts`, located in the utils folder. This component encapsulates common accessibility functionalities, providing a more straightforward interface for developers.

#### a11y.ts Utility

The `a11y.ts` component provides a set of reusable functions that simplify accessibility announcements and status checks. This utility can help ensure that your app communicates effectively with assistive technologies.

1. **`useIsScreenReaderEnabled`**: Checks if the screen reader is currently enabled on the device.

It can be used for preventing a carousel from auto-scrolling when a screen reader is active, for example.

```javascript
import { useIsScreenReaderEnabled } from '~utils/a11y';

function MyComponent() {
  const isScreenReaderEnabled = useIsScreenReaderEnabled();

  if (isScreenReaderEnabled) {
    // Adjust UI for screen reader users
  }
}
```

2. **`announceForAccessibility`**: Sends an announcement to the screen reader with a provided message. This function can be called whenever there is a significant change in the UI that should be communicated to users.

For example, it is used to announce a toast message, or could be used to announce a new message received in a chat app.

```javascript
import { announceForAccessibility } from '~utils/a11y';

const handleNewMessage = (message) => {
  announceForAccessibility({
    message: `New message received: ${message}`,
    // Optional: specify if it should be added to the queue or read immediately
    queue: true,
    // Optional: specify if the announcement should be spoken with a delay
    delay: 1000,
  });
};
```

Using the `a11y.ts` utility allows you to streamline your accessibility implementation in React Native apps. By centralizing your accessibility functions, you can maintain cleaner code and ensure that all announcements and status checks are consistently handled across your application.

For further details on the `a11y.ts` functions, refer to the source code and comments within the utility file.

## Testing Accessibility

To ensure your app is accessible, it’s essential to test it using various tools and methods.

### Screen Readers

Both Android and iOS provide built-in screen readers that you should test your app with:

- **`iOS`**: Use **VoiceOver** _(Settings → Accessibility → VoiceOver)_.
- **`Android`**: Use **TalkBack** _(Settings → Accessibility → TalkBack)_.

> **Note**: It is best to test on real device. You can however use the **Accessibility Inspector** in the iOS Simulator or the **Accessibility Scanner** on Android to simulate screen reader behavior, or use your computer’s screen reader software (_VoiceOver_ on macOS, _Narrator_ on Windows).

Test each screen of your app by navigating with these tools, ensuring that all interactive elements are correctly labeled and usable.

### Color Accessibility Testing

Ensuring that your app is accessible includes checking color contrast and the visibility of elements for users with color blindness or other visual impairments. Below are steps for testing color accessibility on real devices.

### How to Test on a Real Device

#### iOS

1. **Open the Settings App**  
   Tap the Settings app on your iPhone to access the grayscale setting.

2. **Navigate to the Accessibility Menu**  
   On the main Settings page, tap the menu for “Accessibility.” Its icon is blue with a person in a circle.

3. **Tap on the Display & Text Size Menu**  
   Under the “Vision” header, go to the “Display & Text Size” menu. The icon is blue with “AA” text.

4. **Turn On Color Filters**  
   Within the “Display & Text Size” menu is an option for “Color Filters.” Tap this menu, and turn the toggle to “on.”

5. **Select the Grayscale Filter**  
   Under the color filter toggle, you’ll see various color filter options. Tap “Grayscale,” and your iPhone’s display will automatically change to gray shades.

6. **Test Color Contrast**  
   Check the contrast between text and background colors. You can use an online contrast checker to ensure compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards. For example, the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

## Android

1. **Open the Settings App**  
   Tap the Settings app on your Android device.

2. **Navigate to the Accessibility Menu**  
   Scroll down and tap on the “Accessibility” option.

3. **Select the Color Correction Option**  
   In the Accessibility menu, look for “Color correction” or “Color adjustment.” Depending on your device, this may be found under “Visibility enhancements.”

4. **Enable Color Correction**  
   Toggle the color correction option to “on.” You may also see options for different types of color blindness (e.g., Protanopia, Deuteranopia, Tritanopia).

5. **Test Color Contrast**  
   As with iOS, check the contrast between text and background colors. Use an online contrast checker to ensure compliance with WCAG guidelines.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your app is accessible to users with color vision deficiencies and that your color choices meet accessibility standards.

### Platform-Specific Considerations

When developing accessible applications, it’s essential to recognize that different platforms may have unique features and requirements. Here are some considerations for both iOS and Android:

For example, iOS has specific features like `accessibilityViewIsModal` or `magicTap`, while Android has `accessibilityLiveRegion` or `importantForAccessibility` properties.

Please refer to [accessibility properties documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibility-properties) for a complete list of properties and their platform compatibility.

## Maintaining Accessibility

Accessibility is not a one-time setup but a continuous process. To maintain accessibility over time:

- **Code Reviews**: Include accessibility checks in your code review process. Look for missing or incorrect accessibilityLabel, role, or color contrast issues.
- **Automated Testing**: Use tools like `eslint-plugin-react-native-a11y` to automatically catch accessibility issues during development.
- **User Feedback**: Collect feedback from users with disabilities and continually improve the app based on real-world use cases.

## Accessibility checklist

To help ensure your React Native app meets accessibility standards, use the following checklist as a quick reference:

- Ensure all interactive elements have a clear accessibilityLabel.
- Use accessibilityHint to provide additional context for actions.
- Define appropriate accessibilityRole for all UI components.
- Make sure your components handle correctly font scaling.
- Test the app with both iOS and Android screen readers.
